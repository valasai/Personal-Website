# Impact Claims Corrections

## 🎯 **Removed All Unsupported Impact Claims**

All unsupported impact claims have been replaced with neutral, defensible language backed by actual published papers and documented methodology.

## ✅ **Specific Corrections Made**

### 1. **Energy Systems Modeling**
**Before:** "30% reduction in hydrogen LCOE via hybrid renewables"
**After:** "Modeled hydrogen LCOE for Pakistan using TIMES/LEAP/OSeMOSYS; evidence in published papers"

### 2. **Green Hydrogen Economics**
**Before:** "Frameworks adopted by planning authorities"
**After:** "Pyomo/Gurobi optimization for hydrogen pathways; results documented in peer-reviewed articles"

### 3. **Smart Grid Integration**
**Before:** "25% improvement in grid reliability indices"
**After:** "LEAP demand modeling and Python optimization for smart grid scenarios; methodology published"

### 4. **Water-Energy Nexus**
**Before:** "Applied across 6 countries, 15% water savings"
**After:** "OSeMOSYS with water modules for Pakistan's thermal generation water assessment"

### 5. **Energy Security Assessment**
**Before:** "Indices piloted by NEPRA and AEDB"
**After:** "Composite energy security indices for Pakistan (published in Ecological Indicators, 2019)"

### 6. **Renewable Energy Planning**
**Before:** "20% improvement in resource utilization efficiency"
**After:** "Multi-criteria renewable resource selection (Processes/RSER papers); decision framework documented"

## 🔍 **Transparency Enhancements**

### **Added Transparency Note:**
- **Location:** Below Focus Areas section
- **Content:** "Last updated: October 2024 | All impact statements backed by published papers or documented methodology"
- **Styling:** Light background with accent border for visibility

### **CSS Styling:**
```css
.transparency-note {
    margin-top: 2rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    background: var(--light-bg);
    border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-color);
    border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;
}

.transparency-note p {
    margin: 0;
    color: var(--text-muted);
    font-style: italic;
}
```

## 📊 **Content Strategy**

### **Removed Unverifiable Content:**
- ❌ Percentage-based impact claims without documentation
- ❌ "Adopted by planning authorities" without public sources
- ❌ "Piloted by government agencies" without official references
- ❌ Quantified improvements without published evidence
- ❌ Multi-country applications without documented studies

### **Added Factual Content:**
- ✅ **Neutral language** using "modeled," "documented," "published"
- ✅ **Methodology focus** on tools and approaches used
- ✅ **Paper citations** where available (Ecological Indicators 2019)
- ✅ **Transparency notes** with source attribution
- ✅ **Defensible claims** backed by documented evidence

## 🎯 **Key Principles Applied**

### **1. Evidence-Based Claims:**
- Every impact statement backed by published papers or documented methodology
